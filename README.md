# Ghidra disassembly of a SUN 3/60 boot rom

This project contains Ghidra (Version 11.2) data about
a SUN 3/60 boot rom.

The boot rom used is labeled `520-1810-01`


This is work in progress and currently only covers

- a (believed complete) memory map
- a handful of subroutine labels (like `printf`)


520-1810-01.zip is a zip archive of the disassemly (create via
Ghidra's export funtionality). The actual text file
exceeds Github's size limit (100MB).
